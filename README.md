Hi! I'm probably unemployed so I enjoy making things that matter to me, which I hope also means they matter to most people.

This github holds my creations in what I know which is **JavaScript, Python & Scala** and am constantly learning more by the day.
 
I'm a bit obsessed with film, and it inspires me through every facet of my life. My favorite movie is Columbus by Kogonada, my favorite show is De√º/vs by Alex Garland.

Enjoy your stay
